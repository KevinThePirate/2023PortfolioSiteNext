The app collected data on users' tasks, moods, and the times they completed those tasks. This data was used to generate personalized recommendations for improving working habits. 31 participants used the application for two working weeks and after surveying them we found that the app helped them understand their working habits and improve productivity.",

        "desc": "In 2023 I began to develop my portfolio website using React JS and various libraries like Framer Motion and Full Page JS. I initially designed the site's UI as a personal project while working for the Nimbus Research Institute. With a clear vision in mind, I aimed to create a site that showcased my diverse portfolio types. First and foremost, React JS served as the foundation of my website, enabling me to build a highly interactive and responsive user interface. Its component-based architecture facilitated modular development and enhanced code reusability, enabling me to create distinct sections for each portfolio type. To add some flair to my website, I turned to Framer Motion. This animation library allowed me to craft seamless transitions, hover effects, and page-scroll animations. Additionally, I integrated Full Page JS to introduce an intuitive navigation system, enabling users to effortlessly explore various portfolio types. With its smooth scrolling and full-screen sections, Full Page JS elevated the overall user experience. The goal is for this site to exemplify my skills as a Front-End Developer and I feel confident that it has done so.",

        "desc": "For my final year project in Creative Digital Media, I developed a React application that aimed to explore the correlation between habits and mood. This project served as my thesis for my undergraduate degree and was the most ambitious project I have worked on to date.  Leveraging the power of React, I crafted a user-friendly interface that allowed users to log in and seamlessly track their habits and mood over time. By integrating a Firebase backend, I ensured that user data was securely stored and easily accessible. The application enabled users to input their daily habits and record their mood, and then provided visualizations and analysis to showcase any potential connections between the two. This unique approach to understanding the impact of habits on mood resonated with both users and my academic evaluators. I am proud to share that my project received the highest grade in my graduating class. This recognition not only validated my hard work and dedication but also highlighted the potential of utilizing React and Firebase to develop insightful and impactful applications.",

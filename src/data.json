It's all boring, everyday affairs, really. Did I mention the dog was also the boy's chainsmoking teacher? Great stuff",
        "para2": "Tropical Punch is an ongoing action/comedy series that began publication in June of 2022. It is drawn by Ryan Ibbotson and written, lettered and produced by myself. It is sold in comic shops around Ireland, online through Gumroad, and at conventions such as the Cork Zine Fest and the Dublin Comic and Arts Fair. It is currently published in individually printed and released issues with a forthcoming collection of the first 4 issues, standing at over 100 pages long. Tropical Punch has built a loyal and local fanbase in Cork City over the course of its run. In particular, each of the first 3 issues sold out upon release, and as a result in late 2022, the entire series was sent back to the printer for a re-printed second-edition run. This second edition publication has also continued to sell well and has ensured the series' longevity going forward.",

Because of course, he does! If you've got the power to knock bad guys through buildings in your spandex-clad fingertips, why shouldn't you? Who cares about justice, morals or terrorized locals? All you've gotta do is beat the bad guy and Marco The Demon Dude will do whatever it takes... Even if that means blowing up a city in the process.",

It was ultimately collected into an 80+ page graphic novel which went on to win 4 Irish Comic News awards in 2022. Including but not limited to 'Overall Best Irish Comic' and allowed me to win 'Best Small Press Writer'. The book was then allowed me to be shortlisted for a Cork 'Rebel Spirit Award from MBC International and the series was featured in the 'Louder Than Words' Junior Cycle English Textbook as an example of Sequential Storytelling.

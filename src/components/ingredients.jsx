This role had me take on a variety of roles from graphic designer, videographer/editor and web designer. I was the sole motion and graphic designer for the global company on staff. This role had me fielding requests and briefs from across the company where I would develop designs for both employees and external viewers on social media. These tasks would involve me taking large, complex topics and simplifiying them into a graphic, a video or a webpage for employees and other stakeholders. I would often be required to do extensive research on a topic such as a manufacturing process or new orginzational structure so that I could them understand and communicate it to a wider group. These requests, by their nature, needed to be turned around quickly and because of their audience, needed to be at the highest quality. I think this ability to design, develop and communication while managing the interests of various stakeholder groups and ensuring the highest quality would be an asset to your team.",
